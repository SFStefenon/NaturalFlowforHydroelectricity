# Natural Flow of Tucuruí hydroelectric power plant

This dataset has the observed rainfall data of the Tucuruí hydroelectric power plant from the Brazilian National Electric System Operator (in Portuguese Operador Nacional do Sistema - ONS) open data portal. This power plant is located in the Tocantins River basin (Northern Brazil) and has a total installed capacity of 8,370 MW. The observed precipitation available has as data sources the meteorological stations of the National Institute of Meteorology, rainfall stations of the generation agents, and precipitation estimation by the GOES-16 satellite provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

The process of combining data observed at meteorological stations and rainfall stations with satellite estimates is adopted by the ONS to obtain a better representation of the average rainfall of the basins of interest for the operation of the National Interconnected System, given the limitations in the spatial representation of rainfall on a large scale of the observed rainfall collected through rain gauges combined with the low density of rainfall stations in the Brazilian river basins. 

The precipitation and flow example for this dataset is presented here:
